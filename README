This git repository contains an ongoing development for support of Metalink/HTML [RFC 6249] in KGet which is a part of Google Summer of Code project.

For stable version of the KGet source refer to: http://websvn.kde.org/trunk/KDE/kdenetwork/kget/ 

Here is what is supported in the current implementation (this repo) :

Support for Metalink / HTTP as per the RFC 6249. This includes :

1) Links and Hashes (including SHA1, SHA256 and MD5 ) in the HTTP Headers
2) OpenPGP Signatures in the HTTP Headers.

The following features will be added soon:
1) Support for ETag based early download failure detection.
2) Support for Metalink / XML based recovery.

Thanks for stopping by. Have a nice day.
