Basic Installation
==================

        KDE uses the cmake build system. The simple instructions for
building kdenetwork are these commands:

                        mkdir ../kdenetwork-build && cd ../kdenetwork-build
                        cmake ../kdenetwork
                        make
                        make install

        This will not work unless necessary prerequisites are met. These are,
in the order they should be built:

                        kdesupport
                        kdelibs
                        kdepimlibs
                        kdebase

        Various components of kdenetwork and the KDE modules listed above have
other dependencies as well. If these are not met when the 'cmake' command is
run, those components will not be built. The output of 'cmake' should make it
clear what these dependencies are and how to meet them.

        Arguments can be given to cmake similar to those given to a traditional
configure script, like the install prefix. See 'cmake --help-full' for more
information. For example, 'configure --prefix=/usr/lib' translates to
'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib'.
